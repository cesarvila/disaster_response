### Project Title

**Disaster Response** Application

### Description

Using my *skills* learned at **Udacity**, an online educational organization, I
 have created this project to `analyze and classify messages` inspired by
 **Appen**, a company which provides or improves *data* used for the development
  of `machine learning` and `artificial intelligence` products.

In case of a disaster, people in trouble might post messages in social media 
asking for help. There are also other ways to seek for help like calling to
emergency or any other way. The aim of the classification of the messages in
 order to provide the proper support to the people.
